# Rick and Morty

This is a fan React/Typescript project with Apollo and styled-components.
The project is heavily depending and using [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) by @afuh, you should really go on and check on that. It has support for both REST and GraphQL.

The search is somewhat limited right now, but as the API grows, I'll try to keep the project up-to-date.
